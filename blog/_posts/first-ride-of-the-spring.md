Sunday afternoon, partly cloudy but windy...  finally a chance to get on my bicycle!  (ok, I had better weather the day before, but I got caught up in errands and the endless job of unpacking...)

I couldn't find my GPS, but I had my trusty iPhone and an armband case handy.  Time to give the [iMapMyRide](http://www.imapmy.com/) iPhone app a good tryout.  My tires were absolutely flat, but that was easily fixed.  The rest of the bike appeared in pretty good shape.  The only thing I saw that I wanted to do to it was to take the handlebar water bottle cage off.  Then again... I could just rotate the cage up and strap it in place... maybe I could mount my iPhone to it...

Definately not the most aerodynamic contraption, but it will do very well until I get an iPhone mount.  (yes, that is a tire lever stuck into the top to keep the armband from sliding off the top of the cage.

At this point my wife was preparing to head to the store, and I had promised to go with her.  So only time for a short ride around the neighborhood.  I only stayed out a few minutes, then headed back to play with the [iMapMyRide](http://www.imapmy.com/) settings.  I wasn't too happy that it blanked the screen after a few seconds, and I thought I might be able to fix it.  No luck.  The best I could do was to extend the timeout to 2 minutes.  Oh well, time to look around the empty streets to the west for a minute, then get ready to go to the store.

And I broke my seatpost.  Was pulling back into the garage when I heard a crunch and felt my but slide backwards.  I was hoping it wasn't the frame, and it wasn't.  I assume I had the clamp around the carbon seatpost clamped too tight, and/or I just just gained far too much weight over the winter.  Regardless, I was now glad we were going into town because I needed to stop by the bicycle shop.

We went by Phat Tire Bicycle Shop since it was closest.  As I was walking inside, there were several people there with their bikes just coming out of the shop.  But the shop was dark.  They weren't open, they were just gathering for a ride.  They guy I talked to was nice and asked what I was looking for.  However they didn't have a seatpost the correct size in stock.  I had better luck at Lewis & Clark, but they were so busy it took awhile to get in and out with my new post.

On the way home Freedom pointed out some colorful houses, and I figured I'd ride out that way.  But by the time I got there on my bike and stopped to take a picture I realized I had forgotten something important.  That was my [new camera](/blog/post/new-camera-for-this-springs-bicycle-rides).  Well, it wasn't so new anymore, but I hadn't taken it on a bicycle ride yet.  I had also forgotten to close the garage door, but I could have taken care of that with a text to Freedom.   I went back for the camera.

I got my picture, and several others while I was out.  It was a nice easy ride with no destination in mind.  I just wanted to see how my legs had held up since last year and enjoy the day.

I was also able to play with [iMapMyRide](http://www.imapmy.com/), and am fairly impressed.  I set it to tweet my status every mile and talk to me while it was doing so.  Even the screen blanking functionality wasn't as annoying as I had thought at first.  Of course, it is set up that way to lengthen battery life.  iPhones don't particularly last too long on a charge when in use anyway.

Again, I was pleased with battery life.  After being out nearly 90 minutes I still had around a 50% charge, and I left the house with less than a full charge.  I''m sure I'll need to invest in an additional battery of some sort, but I'm more confident that it will be enough (then again, I didn't play any music or podcasts while I was out...)

But the best feature of [iMapMyRide](http://www.imapmy.com/) as far as I am concerned is that it can upload my entire ride even before I get off my bike.  If you look at my ride posts from last year you'll see the maps I created using National Geographic's TOPO and my Garmin Vista Cx GPS.  It worked well but it was enough work that I didn't always do it.

My first challenge was to put an iframe in my post.  That wasn't difficult with a readily available <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embed-iframe/" target="_blank">addon</a>.   I can now see that I would like a way to wrap the text around the iframe holding the image.  That will have to wait for another post, since it's getting late and I'm getting tired.  It all looks promising, and I'm almost sold.

The only thing I am still concerned about is that my rides are saved on someone else's server.  I have no way to back them up, or to assure myself that they will still be available in this format from day to day.
