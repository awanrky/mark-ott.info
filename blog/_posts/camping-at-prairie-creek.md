Freedom and I went camping this weekend at Prairie Creek campground.  We left on Friday evening after I got off work and stayed until Sunday noon.

We packed her car full, and took our bicycles as well.  Thankfully, Freedom's mother had left us a lot of camping equipment when she moved to Arizona, and it came in very handy.  I don't think we could have packed the car any fuller.

Of course, we forgot something, and I said as much to Freedom when we were driving to the campground.  Of course, she told me that I was being pessimistic, but I was right.  We forgot the air pump for our air mattress.   It made the first night at the campground fairly sleepless, but we survived.

On Saturday morning we went back into town and picked up the air pump and more ice.  Then I went on a [bike ride](/blog/post/hot-mid-day-ride-from-campground).  After I got back we ate lunch and went for a swim.  There was some sort of event going on at the boat dock, but we didn't check it out.  There was lots of old (80s) music, and there were many boats out on the lake.
