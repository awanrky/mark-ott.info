Sunday started off as a rainy day, and I didn't think I would be able to take a ride.  Instead I ran some errands, including a trip to the grocery store and a trip to the bike shop to replace one of my CO2 cartridges.

While running around town the weather cleared and I hurried to get back home.  The weather still seemed good, but the weather websites (<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Rogers&amp;state=AR&amp;site=TSA&amp;textField1=36.3312&amp;textField2=-94.1334" target="_blank">weather.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/map/interactive/USAR0485?from=36hour_map_large&amp;zoom=7&amp;interactiveMapLayer=radar" target="_blank">weather.com</a>) both had 'iffy' looking radar images.  I decided to risk it, because it looked to me that the rain was going to stay south of the area.

I took off to the west of town, not sure where I wanted to go, and ended up going down towards Pumpkin Hollow.  I had been down this way before, but I went north the last time.  This time I headed south, towards an area that looked like a dirt road on my GPS.  However, the road looked like it would be paved all the way, and it was.

I ended up out on Highway 72 heading towards Gravette--but I did not want to ride back out to Gravette.  For one thing I did not have time, and for another I wanted to explore.  So instead I eventually turned south towards Centerton--not really exploring, because I had been this way before, but at least I wasn't heading in a direction that would make me retrace my route.

When I got to Highway 102 I saw the regional airport on my GPS and I decided that was where I wanted to go.  I didn't know if I had time or not, but I thought I'd try.

It was really a farily easy ride with a shoulder to ride on most of the way.  There wasn't much traffic either.  When I got closer I thought I saw a route on my GPS that would have less traffic, but after I got to the road I thought I wanted to turn on I found out it was a dirt road.  The second time today my map had lied to me about the surface of a road.

</a>There wasn't much to see at the airport, but I rode through the parking lot and around, and stopped to eat a banana and fix my helmet.

I figured I'd take Highway 12 back to town.  It had a nice shouder to ride on, even though there was quite a bit of traffic.  Before I got halfway back to town I had a flat on my front tire.  My second flat in two days.

I got off the road in the shade of some trees and fixed the flat.  It was a nice rest, and my butt was sore.  It seems that a lot of riding on level roads makes me more sore than periods of climbing.\r\n\r\nIt never did rain, and was a decent ride for Sunday evening.
