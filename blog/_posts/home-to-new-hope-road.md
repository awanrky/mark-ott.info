Today I got a little more experience riding in traffic by heading south of Walnut Street until I (almost) reached New Hope Road.  I got in a little more hill climbing, too, after starting to wonder if there was much hill climbing at all that could be done around here.\n\nRide Length: 16.84 miles\n\n<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/04-03-2009tpomb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26" title="04-03-2009tpomb" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/04-03-2009tpomb.jpg" alt="04-03-2009tpomb" width="598" height="1105" /></a>
