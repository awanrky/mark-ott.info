It was a beautiful Saturday morning!  I started off the day by doing a little maintenance to my bike.  The crankarms were getting noisy so I remounted them, I lubricated my chain, cleaned a few dusty or oily parts, checked the tires, and switched my <a href="http://www.brookssaddles.com/en/Shop_ProductPage.aspx?cat=saddles+-+touring+%26+trekking&amp;prod=Flyer" target="_blank">brooks flyer</a> to my <a href="http://www.spongywonder.com/" target="_blank">spongy wonder</a> saddle (I prefer the spongy wonder for longer rides.)\n\nThen I noticed that I had a problem.  I couldn''t decide where to go.  My last ride had left me <a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/?p=60" target="_blank">wandering aimlessly</a>, and I did not want to go through that again.  A little wandering is good, but it helps to have a general direction in mind.  I loaded up Streets &amp; Trips, and after some clicking around on the map I made up my mind.  I would head south-east of town, and maybe end up at Hickory State Park or the Pleasure Heights area on Beaver Lake.\n\nI made sure to kiss my wife goodbye, and let her know I''d be gone for awhile. Then I headed out.  South on Dixieland, east on Easy St., and across the train tracks.\n\nI enjoy riding through the eastern part of Rogers.  I wouldn''t want to live there--it''s a little run-down for my taste--but it has a nice older town, homey feel to it with the cars parked on the side of the road, people sitting out on their porches, and kids out playing in the street.\n\n<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc00489.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-86 alignleft" title="Kids fishing at Veteran''s Park" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc00489.jpg" alt="Kids fishing at Veteran''s Park" width="500" height="341" /></a>I wasn''t really watching my map, just riding along in a southerly directon trying to stay off the busier roads.  Somehow I ended up headed east again and ran right into a park that I did not know about.  Of course I had to check it out.  Veteran''s Park is a fairly large park for the area, with a small stadium, some ponds out in the middle, and a concrete walking trail around the perimeter and through the middle.  It was not very crowded at the time, but there were people fishing, riding bicycles, and collecting aluminum cans.\n\nI returned to 1st Street and continued south until reaching Lowell, where I ended up on Old Wire Road.  There wasn''t any room on this road to ride out of traffic, but it wasn''t too busy so I continued on.  After awhile I stopped to check my maps and noticed that I had passed the last road heading out to the lake until I got to Springdale, so I backtracked a bit and then headed out east.\n<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc00495.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-82 alignright" title="Beaver Lake near Pleasure Heights" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc00495.jpg" alt="Beaver Lake near Pleasure Heights" width="400" height="300" /></a>While heading east towards Beaver Lake I decided that my destination would be Pleasure Heights.  I was attracted to that particular area because it was just across the lake from my old house on Pine Creek Hollow Road.  Well, I didn''t make it all the way.  Once I got on the penninsula, the road started going up, and down, and up, and down, and up, and down...  And I was geting hungry.  I don''t know why I decided to leave the house on a long ride without even taking a banana with me.  Before long I figured it was time to head back to some town and grab a bite to eat.</p>\n\nSpringdale became my new destination.  It wasn''t a short ride into town, but I had an empty stomach to motivate me.  I even knew where I was going... somewhere with outdoor seating.  The only place I knew of that fit that description was a Sonic just off 412, and I wasn''t going to waste time looking around for somewhere more appetising.\n\nLunch was good, I refilled my water bottles, then topped off with a Snickers Sonic Blast.  I never like the part of a bike ride where I turn back for home.  It is the time where I make the decision that it is time for the ride to come to an end.  It is one reason I like circular rides.  Even though there is always a point where I start generally heading back where I came, there is not a  point where I turn around and head home.  However, this time I could console myself with the fact that this ride was still hours away from ending.\n\nI still did not want to just retrace my route, so I found a different road heading back north and followed it.  It wasn''t long before I ended up back on Old Wire Road looking for another alternate route.  Before I found one my batteries started dying in my gps, so I stopped and bought some new ones.  $5 for four AA batteries--I need to leave home more prepared so that  I can avoid unnecessary expenses like that.  I also need to invest on some new rechargable batteries.\n\nThe rest of the ride home was mostly backtracking my previous route.  I found one more detour, but eventually ended up back on Honeysuckle which lead back to to 1st Street.\n\nBefore reaching home I had to make one more stop at Veteran''s Park.  I was just too tired to go on without a rest and ended up laying down in the grass under a nice shade tree for about half an hour.\n\nIt was a great ride!  I expected to be very sore the next day, but it is now Sunday morning and I don''t feel the ride much at all.  Still, I doubt I''ll take another ride today, and if I do it''ll be a shorter one.\n\nRide Length: 53 miles\nMoving Time: 293 minutes\n\n<a href="http://mark-ott.info/images/05-30-2009.lg.tpo.mb.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78" title="Rogers to Springdale" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/05-30-2009med-smtpomb.jpg" alt="Rogers to Springdale" width="500" height="920" /></a>
