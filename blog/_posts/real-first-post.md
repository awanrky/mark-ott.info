I finally decided to stop procrastinating and dump GoDaddy!  Not because I really have anything against GoDaddy (even though I do get sick of their spam and marketing phone calls.)  My motivation for this change was that I thought it would be fun to re-do my site using Node.

And it was!  Or is... I'm still far from done.  The biggest job is going to be getting my blog moved over to this new format.  That, and prettyifying the entire site.

So, enough posting...I'm gonna get back to work!
