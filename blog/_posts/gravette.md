I hadn''t ridden my new bike in four days.  I took a deliberate break on Tuesday and Wednesday to recover from the previous five days, and on Thursday I came down with my wife''s sore throat.  Even though I was feeling somewhat better on Friday I decided to stay home--especially after checking the weather Friday morning.\r\n\r\nI woke up around 5:30 on Saturday morning, feeling much better, and saw that the weather was forecast to be sunny in the upper 80s.  I wasn''t going to stay home today!\r\n\r\nI did some preliminary planning using Streets and Trips and <a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mapmyride.com/</a>, and decided to head out towards Gravette.  I rode out that direction on my mountain bike earlier this year, but I didn''t make it all the way to Gravette, and I took dirt roads for much of the way.\r\n\r\nBefore I reached the Bentonville Park I started noticing a cramping pain in my upper right leg which made me wonder if I would be able to ride very long today or not.  I decided to ride through the pain, hoping it would go away, or at least not develop into one of those unbearably painful leg cramps.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_174" align="alignleft" width="600" caption="Artwalk on Bentonville Square"]<a

event going on at the Bentonville square that I rode around, and kept on heading out west.  The leg pain got a little easier but did not go away.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Centerton I started playing with my GPS (it''s a <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/manuals/eTrexVistaCx_OwnersManual.pdf" target="_blank">Garmin Vista Cx</a> with the <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=1456&amp;pvID=30132" target="_blank">City Navigator North America NT</a> maps.)  I let the GPS pick my route, but I decided not to go in that direction since it took me on Highway 74, and I thought there might be too much traffic.  Instead, I decided to try to find a route through the smaller roads and found myself back at Highway 102.  Since there was a Sonic right there, I decided to stop for some lunch before continuing on out of town.\r\n\r\nSonic has become my usual place to stop for food or water, not because I like the food, but because Sonics usually have outdoor seating where I don''t have to worry about locking up my bike and going inside in the air conditioning.  They also have good drinks and deserts.\r\n\r\nAfter eating (and resting) the pain in my leg came back, but I wasn''t going to let that stop me.  I kept going and found my way along some smaller roads with less traffic but no shoulders to speak of.  Every time I would take a turn off the path ''recommended'' by my GPS it would calculate a new path that I also ended up not wanting to take.  I reached a Y in the road, with my GPS telling me to take the southern route, but the northern route seemed to be more direct.  Since the southern route had a sign saying ''crooked and steep'', and since my leg was still hurting, I decided to take the northern direction--I''ll take the southern road next time.\r\n\r\nThe northern road lead me to Highway 72 a bit before Gravette.  The nice thing about 72 near Gravette is that it has nice wide shoulders.  I started wondering how far they extended east towards Centerton.\r\n\r\nBy the time I got to Gravette I was nearly out of water, so I decided I needed to stop somewhere.  I pulled over at a grocery store and tried using the ''find'' feature on my GPS and found... a Sonic.  A slush sounded good right now, so I hopped on my bike and let the GPS lead me.\r\n\r\nWhen I got on the road I noticed that my bike didn''t want to settle on a gear at first.  It was the first shifting problem I''ve had with the new bike--normally it shifts very responsively.  It worked itself out however, so I didn''t think too much of it.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Sonic and hopped off my bike I noticed that I had left my headphones on my seat, and that they had dropped down into my spokes.  This was what had caused the shifting problem leaving the store, because the headphones wrapped around my rear sprocket, and had been ripped apart.  Oh well, they were a cheap set, and they weren''t the first headphones I''ve lost in my spokes.\r\n\r\nI ordered a strawberry slush and a Route 44 water and sat down to look for a store in Gravette to get some more headphones.  A Dollar General... perfect!  The GPS lead me right there and I found a cheap pear for $4.00.  The only problem was that it is the kind that block off my entire ear canal, making it harder to hear traffic.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_175"

and take pictures.  Then I continued on east, back towards Centerton.\r\n\r\nThe nice shoulders continued even past Hiwasse and it was a nice, easy ascent all the way.  I only ran into one problem--my first flat on the new bike.  I had wondered what it was like to get a hole on those small tires, and I found out--at least when the tire doesn''t go completely flat all at once.  It just got real bumpy, and I looked back and noticed that my rear tire was not up all the way.\r\n\r\nI pulled off the road into the shade of a tree and fixed the tire.  I was able to find the hole and put a patch on the tube, so I didn''t have to use my spare.  It was a pinprick hole, and I found the matching cut in the tire.  Probably a piece of glass.  I had to get used to my new pump (it is a CO2 model that has a hand pump as well.)  I didn''t quite get the pump on right and the tire didn''t get as inflated as I would have liked, but it would do.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the ride home was fairly uneventful.  I stopped at another Sonic and refilled my water and rode back to the Bentonville park where I stopped for a minute and ate the bananas I had taken with me.  Then I decided it was time to end the ride.  I didn''t want to, but I was tired and my leg was still hurting, so I figured I''d just hope I can find some time to ride on Sunday, even with a 50% chance of heavy rain.\r\n\r\nRide Length: 56.5
