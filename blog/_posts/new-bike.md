<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://mark-ott.info/pictures/lemond_reno_large_dsc04561.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-114 alignright" title="lemond_reno_small_dsc04561" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/lemond_reno_small_dsc04561.jpg" alt="lemond_reno_small_dsc04561" width="300" height="185" /></a>Today  I bought a new road bike.  It''s a Lemond Reno Double 2008 that I got from <a href="http://phattirebicycles.com/" target="_blank">Phat Tire Bike Shop</a>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I have been wanting a road bike for awhile, especially since I''ve been riding in and around town a lot lately.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Of course I had to take a ride after work.  It didn''t take long into my ride before I had to break one of my usual routines.  Normally I ride on a trail alongside Hudson Street, which of course I could not do today.  This left me two options--ride on Hudson in lots of traffic or walk my bike along the trail.  I decided to walk my bike, which was a very tedious walk that I decided I would not do again.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the trail I headed north on Dixieland towards Little Flock, then east into Bentonville.  There were a few hills along the route, which was my first chance to see how the new bike would do.  I wasn''t expecting the gearing to be so difficult on a climb.  I am used to the small chainring on my mountain bike, and this new road bike did not have anything close.  However, I found that the climbs weren''t too difficult.   If I just kept pedaling I had no trouble making it to the top--I even found that it was much easier to pedal in a circle, instead of the push, push, push habit that I have been trying to break.  I also found that the same hills got my heartrate up much higher than I had been doing.  Not to mention that I was climbing about twice as fast.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I rode around Bentonville for awhile, then headed to the north trail.  It was a strange feeling riding by Slaughter Pen and realizing that I could not go there on this bike.  I did not like that feeling at all, but there was so much more that I was really liking about this bike.  It is much more comfortable than my mountain bike, and I already average several miles an hour faster.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">After the north trail, I turned again to the north, in a direction that I had told myself earlier that I was not going to go.  This is because that road leads to Highway 74, and from there I either had to take the highway or a dirt road--and I couldn''t take the dirt road.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">So I headed south on 74.  The traffic made me miserable, but I enjoyed the long shallow climb along the good road.   As soon as I could I turned off into a residential area, and headed back home along safer roads.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">When I got to the intersection of Dixieland and Hudson, I rode on Hudson instead of walking my bike.  Luckily the traffic was light.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I am very happy with my new bike.  I''m going to have to get used to avoiding routes with dirt roads, and I''m going to have to get used to riding in traffic more.  But it''s well worth it.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align: left;">Ride Length: 25 miles\nMoving Time: 120 minutes\nBike Ridden: Lemond\n<p style="text-align: left;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-115" href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/?attachment_id=115"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115" title="06-04-2009_ride_topo_map" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/06-04-2009tpomb.jpg" alt="06-04-2009_ride_topo_map" width="1000" height="997" /></a></p>
