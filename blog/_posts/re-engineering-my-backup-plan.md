I've always been conscious of the need to keep backups.  It started with boxes and boxes of floppies, which quickly gave way to boxes upon boxes of CD-Rs.  Even now I have a very large box of disks and discs shoved away in the back of a closet, containing junk from up to twenty years ago--junk I will most certainly never need again but do not want to get rid of.

Not that I"m a hoarder.  More of a packrat.  My wife has been very helpful in encouraging me to throw away old junk.  Computers, other bits of electronics, old clothing, dishes, toys--they've all found their way past the junkpile and into the trash over the past few years we have been married.  But I'm not throwing away all my old bits.  Why should I want to keep old bits of 16-bit windows code, DOS assembly programs, a Falcon 3.0 graphical launcher, out of date resumes, homework assignments, e-mail, newsgroup postings, ... ?  They're all works of my creative effort.  All of them are certainly primitive efforts that I couldn't possibly find any use for now, but they all taught me something in the best way anyone can possibly be taught.  They taught me how to do something through the act of doing.

I also have other bits that I am more proud of.  I have more than a decade of digital photographs stored away on a hard drive.  And that is a fragile thing. 

But don't think I would trust all of those bits to the integrity of a single hard drive.  I had them on two.  One copy of the bits was kept on a network-writable drive, and I would keep adding to those bits daily.  The other copy was on a network-readable drive (sadly on the same physical machine as the first) and it would get all the new files from the first every evening.  And if any of the files on the first drive changed, it kept a copy of the changed file, and the previous version.

This all worked very well for several years, until the other day when the read-write drive crashed.  Of course, that's no big deal.  That's why I keep two copies.  Except that now I had a broken backup plan, a single copy of my valuable files, and I needed time to rebuild.  This meant that nothing was being backed up.  For over two weeks. 

So after that two weeks I invested some of my time to restoring my backup plan.  And just as important, restoring my access to my backups.  My backups were all on the machine with the failed hard drive, and I had no other working desktop to plug the backup drive into. 

So in addition to going out and buying a GoFlex Home network drive to store all my bits, I had to find a way to get to those bits.  And that was just the start.  I also needed a new plan. 

I decided to keep the core of my old plan.  Two copies of everything.  To do this, I had a non-functional desktop, a laptop with a mere 120 GB (SSD) hard drive, and a 2TB network drive.  I clearly needed to make the desktop functional again.

Of course, the smart thing to do would be to replace the bad drive with a new one, but I had already shelled out enough cash for the GoFlex.  So I decided to make my old backup drive bootable.  If you don't know what a bad idea this was, just think.  My only copy of all my data was on this drive and I was about to start screwing around with it so that I could get the bits off of it.  I am plenty confident of my ability to do this with little risk, but little risk does not mean no risk.

So the old desktop was running Vista before it crashed, and for several reasons I decided to keep Vista on it.  But my copy of Vista is an upgrade copy that won't let me install on a drive without a previous version of Windows.  Long but easy solution: install XP first.  And that is what screwed me.  I never wasted the time figuring out exactly what the XP install did, and I surely didn't go deliberately mucking around with the partition table, but I ended up with a 120 GB partition on the backup drive, and no backup partition.  This sucked!
