Last week Freedom and I were watching coverage of the tornado in Moore, OK and she told me, matter-of-fact, "hmm, my storage unit is in Moore--I should probably call and check to see if it was damaged."  Neither one of us thought much more of it after that.  A few days later she got an e-mail stating that the facility was damaged and was closed--but they couldn't give more information than that.  Then another e-mail stating that two of the buildings would be open.  Neither of the buildings contained her unit.  So she called and found out that the roof had been torn off the building containing her unit and they didn't have more information than that.

Then over the Memorial Day weekend she got another e-mail stating that she could get into her unit but she had to sign a waiver and take heavy boots, gloves, and a mask before she could get in.  It didn't sound good, so we planned a trip for Monday to see if there was anything that could be salvaged.

About the time we got into Moore my fuel light came on, so I told her we needed to get gas before heading to the unit.  "No problem, there's a gas station just off our exit."  So far we had seen no damage, only a sign on the interstate warning drivers they were entering a disaster area, and not to slow down to see the damage.

We took our exit, and Freedom immediately started crying... "the gas station is gone!"

And it was.  There was a demolished sign where the station used to be, but nothing resembling a building.  The picture and video above show the remains of the station as we drove by.  We did find a gas station, but the gas... wasn't cheap.

The people at the storage business were extremely friendly and very helpful.  They had the roads around the buildings cleaned off very well so I wasn't worried about getting a flat from debris, and we were able to drive right up to the unit.

The roof and all the doors had blown off the units on her side of the building, but it looked like most of her items were still there--although the wind had pushed them to the back and there was debris covering everything.  Most of the debris was insulation, shingles, and splintered pine.  There wasn't any wood construction nearby, so who knows how far all the shredded bits of house had flown to end up packed in with Freedom's possessions.

I started pulling everything out while Freedom went through the boxes and decided what could be kept and what was now trash.  There was splintered wood in and under every box I pulled out.  All the cardboard boxes were crushed and waterlogged, and very few things packed in cardboard were undamaged.  They were either crushed or soaked with water, or both.  At the same time there were many delicate glass items that came through without a scratch.  Items in the plastic tubs fared much better.  There were a couple of tubs that had cracked open, and one that was full of water and a complete loss.  But most of the items in the tubs were dry and unscathed.

I think she threw away more than she kept, but she found her father's ashes and her photo albums, which were the two things she was worried about the most.  Almost all the pictures had at least some water damage, and some were completely ruined.  After we had removed everything from the unit I looked down and saw one remaining picture, of her nephew Andrew and in amazingly good shape, staring up from the debris.

We eventually had everything packed and headed home, exhausted.

On the way out Freedom got a few more pictures from the truck...

The next two pictures are from a strip mall next to the storage buildings.  In the first you can see completely through the mall, where one shop was plucked right out of the building.

In the second you can see the mall from the front.  When I first saw this I wondered why the one store would be completely destroyed while the others were left sortof intact.  While looking at these pictures again, especially the one before this one, it appears that the store that was destroyed was right in front of an empty space where there were no storage buildings behind it.  I think it might have offered the wind less resistance in this one spot because of that.

I also put most of the pictures we took, which in include many not seen here, on my [skydrive account](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=DDF88DD27147FE91!3601).  These are the full, unedited files copied directly from the camera.
