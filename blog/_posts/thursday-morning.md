Got camp set up last night and took patience for a walk.  We went down to the lake and I let her run along the shore.  Surprisingly, she didn''t get all the way in, but she did do some wading.

Came back to camp and had one of my Irish Stouts I brewed in January.  It sure was good, either they get better with age, or they''re just better on a camping trip in early June.

We're in probably the best camping spot in the whole park.  Woods most of the way around us--very private compared to all the other spots.  Last night after dark, we heard some rustling and footsteps in the woods by the tent.  Patience got excited and wanted to go find out what it was--and almost choked herself trying to dart into the woods.  From now on, I''m putting her harness back on her at night, instead of just using the collar.

I thought I had all the food and trash put up before we went into the tent, but it only took a couple of minutes before a raccoon came into camp and found an empty pringles can.  I had no idea a pringles can could make so much noise!

I can''t believe how well Patience is doing.  She wants to bark at the dogs in the next camp so bad, but she is restraining herself very well.  And when I can tell it is getting too much for her to resist, I can call her over, and she runs to me, sits down, and has me pet her.

Well, going to post a few pics, pack up camp, go for a walk, then think about heading out
