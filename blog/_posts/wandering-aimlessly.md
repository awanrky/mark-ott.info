</a>This evening I wanted to get out and ride... somewhere.  I didn't have a place in mind, so I just headed out.  My first idea would be to head out to work and explore those streets.  Maybe there was something interesting back there.  There wasn't.  So I just kept riding around.  And around, and around, and around.  I guess the most interesting part of this ride was getting buzzed by some rude or unconscious guy in a prius.</p>

It was still enjoyable, but next time I'm going to head out with some idea where I want to explore.  Even if I decide not to go that direction...
