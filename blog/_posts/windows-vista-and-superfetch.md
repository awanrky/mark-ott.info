I like Windows Vista.   Using a 64-bit machine with 2+ GB memory, I would definately choose a 64-bit install of Vista over XP.   That's what I have on my home PC, and it's what I wish was running on my work PC.

That's not to say that there aren't things about Vista that drive me nuts.  I don't want to go into the full list here--for most of them I haven't even bothered to figure out how to reconfigure Vista to change their default behavior.

But there is one 'feature' of Vista that I consider much more annoying than the rest, mainly because it wasted a great deal of my time--until I turned it off.

According to the Microsoft website, 'SuperFetch monitors which applications you use the most and preloads these into your system memory so they'll be ready when you need them.'

This sounds OK in theory, and maybe there are some situations where it actually works well.  For instance, if I had more than 2GB memory in my machine I might expect some improvement.  But in practice, on my machine, leaving SuperFetch on left the hard drive grinding almost constantly, and resulted in extremely long pauses when trying to resume work after leaving the machine idle for awhile.

SuperFetch runs as a Windows service, and can be disabled by disabling the service.  If you would like a more detailed explanation, visit <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/how-to-disable-superfetch-on-windows-vista/" target="_blank">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/how-to-disable-superfetch-on-windows-vista/</a>\n\nIf you're running Vista, I suggest turning SuperFetch off for awhile.  If you don't notice an improvement, then turn it back on.  If you do notice an improvement, it might be big enough that you find you like Vista more than you thought you did.  Or that you hate it less...
