Saturday Morning
Just a quick post to summarize the last two days. Will fill in with more details and pictures later…

We left camp thursday morning and headed up towards Kansas City,finding a nice park and lake just outside of the city in the afternoon. Patience was ready for a walk,but I was ready for lunch. We comprimised and took a short walk before sitting down for some sandwiches in the shade.

After lunch we took off down a trail along the lake shore. I thought it would be just a quick walk before we headed out,so I didn’t take any water along. But I guess both of us were ready to spend some time outside,because we just kept walking and walking. At first I tried keeping to the shade because Patience’s nose burns easily in the sun,but she just wanted to walk straight down the trail. Before we got to the end I could tell she was really needing some water,so I threw out some jerky I was carrying along for our snacks,and filled up the bag with water for her to drink. As we headed back,this time it was Patience keeping us in the shade.

We got back to the truck both exausted and lay in the shade of a nice oak tree for much too long. I had wanted to drive further that day,but instead I started looking around for a place to set up camp.

There didn’t seem to be much north of Kansas City for camping,but I did see an Indian Cave State Park just on the other side of the Missouri to the north. However,the web site didn’t look too promising–I don’t remember what,something about reservations or check-in time…The park looks very interesting,so I may check it out on the way back.

I found several that looked promising just to the west in Kansas,and although I was planning to avoid Kansas,we headed off to the west towards Topeka. We ended up at a nice big lake with a primitive tent campground and an RV campground just up the road. I got a spot right off the lake in the tent campground. We were the only campers in it (the RV campground was fairly crowded)

Set up camp and took a walk along the lake just before dark. Lots of herons on this lake,and we got to see one standing in the water near shore,looking for a fish. I stood as still as possible,and surprisingly Patience was pretty still as well. It didn’t take a minute before I saw it take off with a fish in its mouth. It was so quick,I’m not even sure I saw it catch the fish. It was just standing still,looking in the water one instant,and the next instant it was in flight,carrying its dinner.

We were both ready for bed early,and I didn’t even bother pulling out the computer,but I did sit out for awhile and read on the kindle until the bugs chased me into the tent.

Not long after we lay down,some coyotes started singing for us. Just as I was dozing off,someone showed up and started putting up a tent. Patience growled a bit,and gave them a few quiet ‘ruff’s,just to let them know she was there,but they were quiet and I dozed off before they finished setting up camp.

We woke up early and sat on the lake shore drinking morning coffe and (I) eating dry cereal (I forgot to bring milk,but I didn’t feel like cooking this morning. I have never seen a lake with so many fish jumping. Not sure what they stock it with,but either they are a jumping variety,or the lake is so full that it can’t hold them all at once!

About the time I was through packing up,our neighbors finally stirred. It was a very young couple–I would be surprised if either were yet 20 years old–and they were not very social (neither am I),but they didn’t even look over the entire time,so my attempts to wave good morning were useless.

So after a morning walk we headed north into Nebraska. We got a late start (I took a shower,and was fairly slow getting around) so it was well after noon before we pulled over for a break. I found a place on the map just a bit to the east,and on the shore of the Missouri,but when we got there I was surprised at what I found. Just a run-down parking lot,but it had some nice big trees,so I parked under one and we took a walk. It was a better spot than I thought at first–there is an old steamboat there that looks like it was once an attraction,but has been long abandoned. I got some good pictures,and Patience got to wade a bit in the Missouri.

We headed off back west,and I was getting tired already,so I started looking for a place to stop for the night. Found State Park,but they didn’t have camp sites,only ‘teepee’camping,but the guide directed me on west to State Park. As I got there,I saw a huge building and had to find out what it was–The Strategic Air and Space Museum. Oh boy!

When I pulled into the park,the guide let me know it was full,but directed me on west to the Memphis State Park,and it sounded morel like what I was looking for anyway. A primitive tent campground with a lake. I also asked him a few qestions about the museum–I would love to go,but not this trip with Patience.

Memphis park is perfect,a nice sized tent campground with a small lake. Very popular with fishermen,and in good shape. I found us a spot at the edge,away from everyone,and set up camp.

We took an evening walk and got some good pictures. At one point,I thought Patience was going to pull me in the lake because she tried to take off after a fising lure someone cast nearby.

I built a fire (first fire I bothered to build so far this trip) and sat up watching the fire,listening to a nearby owl,and drinking a few of my home brews. Patience crawled in the tent early and went to sleep. I followed sometime after midnight,and got the best night’s sleep so far on the trip.

We got up at sunrise,I made some coffee and cooked some bacon and eggs over the fire,and almost have camp packed up. We’re going to take a morning walk,and then head out west across Nebraska…
