Today I headed out to visit my dad and take my kayak out on the lake for a bit. I had a nice visit, got to pet Cleo, and Margo fixed a great lunch with fresh corn on the cob, green bean casserole, Dad''s potato salad, biscuits and fresh cucumbers.  We topped it off with some strawberries and topping over a biscuit.<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04547.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-94 alignnone" title="dsc04547" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04547.jpg" alt="dsc04547" width="800" height="600" /></a>\n\nI lost my gps map of the lake trip, but I went out a few miles, then turned around and headed back.  After around two hours of paddling my arms sure were tired!<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04529.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-93 alignnone" title="dsc04529" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04529.jpg" alt="dsc04529" width="600" height="800" /></a>
