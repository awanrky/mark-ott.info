We saw a mockingbird standing on a sundial, so I stopped to try to get a picture.  The mockingbird was cranky, though, as mockingbirds can be, so it didn't cooperate.  Instead, it flew up into a tree right above our heads and cussed us out.  Here is a picture of Patience listening to the mockingbird letting us know exactly what it thinks of us.

Lunchtime, our first stop of the day.

I wanted to see who this was, but Patience wouldn''t let me get close enough to read the sign.
