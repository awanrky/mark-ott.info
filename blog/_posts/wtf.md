Ever read the website <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/" target="_blank">The Daily WTF</a>?  I found something today that qualifies, I think.  It may make sense to everyone else, but I just can''t see how it is a good idea.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/cover_the_earth.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-72 aligncenter" title="cover_the_earth" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/cover_the_earth.jpg" alt="cover_the_earth" width="350" height="366" /></a></p>\n\nIt was mounted on the side of a Sherwin Williams paint store.  And on the side of their pickup truck.  And on the door...\n\nNow, I am no environmentalist, but I just can''t see a logo of the earth covered in a goopy sludge pouring out of a can labeled with the company''s initials as sending a positive message.\n\nDoes this not strike anyone else as odd?
