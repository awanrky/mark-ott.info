I had been looking forward to this day for awhile.  It was the first day I could get out and take a day-long ride on my <a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/?p=113" target="_blank">new bike</a>.\n\nSadly, I didn''t get started until around 2:30 that afternoon.   I had a few errands to run first, one of which included stopping somewhere to pick up some batteries for my GPS and camera.  I should have just stopped by Neighborhood Market, but since I was interested in replenishing my stock of rechargable AAs, I thought I''d go to Best Buy and see what they had.\n\nBest Buy is always a mistake.  Not only did I waste time looking around at everything, as always I found something to buy that I hadn''t planned on.  This time it was something for my bicycle.  I found a neat little tripod with flexible legs that I thought would fit perfectly around my handlebars.  This would give me a way to mount my camera without clamping anything to my bike.\n\nThe device worked (almost) perfectly.  It really does get a good grip, and it is easy to put on and take off.  The only problem I saw was that the piece that screws into the camera doesn''t clamp onto the rest of the tripod very securely--it has a little wobble.  It wasn''t bad, so I took off without much concern.\n\nSince I still wasn''t confident in my climbing ability with the double chainring on this road bike, I thought I''d head towards Avoca since the road is mostly level.\n\nAt Avoca  I turned off towards Woods Lodge Road.   I will try to avoid this road in the future.  It was a bit too rough in places.   Not only was it rough on my bike, it was rough on my other equipment as well.\n\nI was in the drops gaining speed down a hill when the road suddenly got rough again.   I hit a fairly large rough spot and heard something go tumbling off my bike.  At first I thought it was my GPS.  Stopping as fast as I could, I turned around and started riding back up the hill to find it.  Of course, some cars came down the hill at that time, and I had to hope they didn''t run it over.\n\nI didn''t see it on my first pass.  Luckily it wasn''t my GPS that fell--it was my camera.  I noticed this while turning to go back down the hill.  It took about three passes before I finally found it, just off the side of the road.  The case was slightly separated and a trim piece had fallen off the front.  I never did find the trip piece.  Upon further examination, I determined that the new tripod did not have a very good grip on the piece that mounts to the camera.\n\nI popped the camera back together and turned it on.  Everything appeared to work fine.   However, the camera would not take a good picture.  All pictures taken with it had horizontal lines throughout the entire picture.  This was a major disappointment, but I bought the camera several years ago just for bike rides, and back then I didn''t expect it to last more than a couple months.  I got much more use out of the camera than  I had intended, but now I don''t have a replacement.  My other two cameras are much too large to take on a ride.  Until I can afford a replacement  I will have to just use the camera on my phone.\n\n<a rel="attachment wp-att-147" href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/?attachment_id=147"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-147" title="rogers_water_tower_dsc00514" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/rogers_water_tower_dsc00514.jpg" alt="rogers_water_tower_dsc00514" width="400" height="300" /></a>\n\nI continued riding out towards Lost Bridge Village but I didn''t make it all the way to the lake.  It was getting a little late, and I was getting a little hungry (I had neglected to take a snack on another long ride) so I turned north towards Garfield.\n\nThere was more traffic in this direction, but the road was nice.  I am starting to enjoy riding on the highway more and more, even with some traffic.  Riding in traffic more has lead me to a question that I will probably never see answered... "Why is it that I come across so many people driving Priuses that do not leave me any room when passing... even when there is clearly no traffic coming in the other direction?"  It seems to me that people driving ''green'' cars would encourage bicyclists, not try to run them off the road.\n\nI stopped at one of the Garfield convenience stores, replenished my water and ate a Snickers.  While I was resting and eating a rather strange man came up and started examining my bike.  He was friendly but said some of the strangest things, like "None of us will ever deserve all the nice shit we have."  Then he showed me how neat his pocket knife was, saying "there''s no reason anyone would ever make anything like that other than because they can."  t was an interesting blade, folding sideways into the handle instead of the way pocket knives usually fold.  I don''t know if he was trying to be threatening by pulling his knife out or not.  I didn''t feel threatened, because I think he was just trying to show me something that he owned he was proud of.  I did feel sorry for the man, because he seemed like a truly confused person.  When he walked away he thanked me for letting him look at my bike.\n\nI rode out on 62 towards Avoca and found myself enjoying the openess of the road.  There was plenty of room for traffic to pass most of the time, and lots of open downhill runs to get up some speed.  I did find myself struggling on some of the hills, not because they were very steep--they weren''t--but because I was tired at this point and the hills were long.  That, and  still haven''t gotten used to the double crankset.\n\nI keep thinking about getting a compact crank, and I keep going back and forth.  I''d hate to lose those extra three teeth on the large chainring, but an easier gear sure would be nice.  However, I''m getting more and more used to the gearing and if I stick with it I think I''ll prefer it.  The only thing I''m really worried about is hurting my knee so that I won''t be able to ride for awhile.\n\nAfter reaching Avoca, I turned off 62 and retraced my path back to Rogers.\n\nIt was a fun ride.  I found myself liking my new bike more than ever and am already looking forward to the next ride.\n\nRide Length: 194 minutes\nMoving Time: 41.2 miles\nBike Ridden: LeMond\n\n<a href="http://mark-ott.info/pictures/06-06-2009.tpo.mb.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-142 alignleft" title="06-06-2009smalltpomb" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/06-06-2009smalltpomb.jpg" alt="06-06-2009smalltpomb" width="800" height="558" /></a>
