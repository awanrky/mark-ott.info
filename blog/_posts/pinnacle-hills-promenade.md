Freedom and I went down to Pinnacle Hills so she could pick some clothes, and so that I could look around a bit.   Instead of hanging around looking at women's clothing I decided to take a walk.

It was a nice evening and it wasn't too cold, and I thought it would be fun to take some pictures.   Luckily, I had a <a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/post/new-camera-for-this-springs-bicycle-rides">camera in my pocket</a>.  I have never done much nighttime photography, so most of what I did was just to experiment with the camera settings.    I came up with a couple that were weren't too bad, and more that were pretty blurry.  It would have been nice to have had a tripod in my pocket as well.

After taking a few pictures I continued on down the road and found a GameStop, so I stepped inside to look around a bit.  I managed to leave without buying anything, and figured it was about time to go find Freedom.

Then I happened to look around the corner and see a Borders.  So much for finding Freedom right away.  I figured that she would call if she got impatient, so I headed on inside the store.

It was very disappointing to see that they have reduced the amount of space set aside for computer books.  The only interesting things I saw in that section are books that I already own.  Still, I managed to find enough to look at that I was still there when they started kicking people out of the store.

By the time I found Freedom again she was still quite happy shopping, and we stayed until it was time to be kicked out of her store as well.
