Ok, this isn''t a post about <a href="windows.microsoft.com/ie9" target="_blank">IE 9 beta</a>.  But I do have the beta to thank for this post.\n\nI loaded up the browser this evening and started clicking around.  It works well, and so far I''m pretty pleased.  After a bit I wandered onto my long-neglected site and started looking at some of my old blog posts.  It was very enjoyable seeing all the pictures and reading what I was doing at the time.  Too bad I hadn''t posted in awhile.  Almost all of 2010 is a complete blank.\n\nMy original idea for this blog was to write more so I could get better at writing.  It has helped, and would help more if I kept at it.  I wasn''t interested in finding an audience, but I figured that posting in a public place (even if that public place was just a dark corner of a massive wilderness) would provide some motivation to do well.  To my surprise I found that I do have an audience... me!  And I''ve let myself down.  Time to make amends, and providing myself with a quick recap of the past year is a good way to start.\n\nFirst, though, I''ll stay on the original subject for one quick paragraph.  That is, I found one thing in IE 9 beta that I cannot do, and that is to use the ''Visual'' tab of the post editor using IE 9 beta with the particular version of wordpress that I have installed.  So I''m back to using my old standby favorite browser to write the text of this post.  (What is my favorite browser at the moment?  Chrome!)\n\nSo how did the year go?...\n\n[caption id="attachment_310" align="aligncenter" width="1024" caption="Bad image splice of the most fantastic rainbow I&#39;ve ever seen"]<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rainbow.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-310" title="rainbow"

as good as that rainbow.   There were many tough stretches to get through.  But nothing was all that bad, either.  It was like trying to swim upstream, fighting the current all the way.\n<h3>Riding my bicycle</h3>\nI didn''t.  That is, I didn''t ride very much.  At all.  I had the motivation, but I didn''t have the will.  Nothing much more to say about that except I am ashamed.  I love to ride, and I feel good when I have ridden.  I am looking forward to this spring and I will not tolerate letting myself just waste away the opportunity to do what I want to do.\n<h3>My computer</h3>\nIt''s the same old GM5088 that I bought just after I started at CTL.  I have moved it all around the house; working at the dining room table, on the love seat, in my recliner, and in the ''office.''  It is now in the office set up beside the window, which is probably the second best place so far (with the dining room table being the best--except for the fact that it was on the dining room table.)\n\nI put Vista back on it, simply because of the fact that I wanted to play with WP7 programming, and the VS edition for Windows Phone won''t run on XP.  It is working pretty good--but I still haven''t played with WP7 programming that much...\n\n(And yes, I bought a <a href="microsoft.com/WindowsPhone" target="_blank">Windows Phone 7</a> around Christmastime, and I am extremely pleased with it.)\n\nI also bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Y27P3M/ref=kindlesu-1" target="_blank">Kindle</a>, and I am pleased with it as well--even pleased enough that I thought my dad should have one, and bought it for him so that he <em>would </em>have one!\n<h3>Dogs!</h3>\n[caption id="attachment_312" align="alignleft" width="400" caption="Marley and Patience"]<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/marley_and_patience.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-312" title="Marley and Patience" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/marley_and_patience.jpg" alt="Marley and Patience" width="400" height="300" /></a>[/caption]\n\nFor Freedom, one of the best motivators of getting out of our old apartment was that she could get a dog--and that she did.  She got a c<span>hihuahua-terrier mix (Marley) from the <a href="www.bellavista-animalshelter.org/" target="_blank">Bella Vista animal shelter</a>, and a few months later adopted a boxer-lab mix (Patience) that wandered into our front yard.</span>I have never been too fond of dogs, and the past few years riding my bicycle has further decreased my appreciation of them.  Furthermore, I had decided awhile back that I didn''t want any more pets.\n\nBut these two are really good dogs who have both found a very special place in my life.  I wouldn''t want to be without them.\n<h3>Our ''new'' place</h3>\n(The one we moved into during the very early spring of 2010.)\n\nThe move was a big improvement for both of us.  There have been some struggles and unfulfilled plans, but we''re much better off here.\n\n''The office'' has changed from office to storage room to exercise room to <em>whatever </em>more times than I can count.  It is now serving the purpose of computer room for me, and soon-to-be exercise room for us both.  I''m sitting in it now with all the exercise equipment we own haphazardly sitting around the floor, still not set up to be useful.\n\nI finally got Freedom a punching bag for Christmas (she has been wanting one forever, but hasn''t had a chance to even punch it yet--she came down with pneumonia just before Christmas and still hasn''t fully recovered.)\n\nBut the punching bag is hanging too low--I still need to pick up a new s-hook for it.  The exercise bike needs batteries, and the ''stepper'' machine is serving as a coat holder for the moment.\n\nThe dogs are constantly trying to dig new holes in the back yard.  I tried to grow some tomatoes using a topsy-turvey this summer, but Marley ate the plant--tomatoes and all.  I also tried growing some peppers in a topsy-turvey, but that was a complete failure even without the dogs being able to reach, and eat, the plants.\n\nWe spent over a month this summer with Chastity, McKenzie, and Haddox as houseguests.  And another month around Christmas with Freedom''s mom as a houseguest.  It was nice we could help them out, but I do like my own space and it was difficult for me to adjust.\n<h3>Work</h3>\nI''m still at CTL, and Freedom is working at a place called Feet Plus, where she is mostly happy.\n\nMy main focus at work is still with Javascript, but I''ve had a chance to work in C# on one project, and I don''t want to go back!\n\nI have made great improvements in my ability to write simpler, easy-to-read, and better documented code.  Working in .NET has helped me with this, but I have been able to carry it back to my Javascript code as well.\n\nI am learning to use Linq and C# Lambdas, which makes it even harder to go back to Javascript--the thing I liked most about JS was the ability to use anonymous functions in a more ''functional'' style of programming.  Now I have come to find that C# has added the very thing I like, while maintaining the strongly-typed, compilable code I am used to and far more productive using.\n\nNow I am stretching further, working on a few Javascript projects and attempting to do so using <a href="code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/" target="_blank">JsTestDriver </a>to create unit-tests and developing in a TDD-like style.  Right now I''m struggling with the tool and learning to write tests for code that uses the ExtJS library.  It is taking a lot of time, but when I have the tests right testing and debugging my production code is a piece of cake!\n\nI still haven''t settled on a Javascript editor that I like.  <a href="www.netbeans.org" target="_blank">NetBeans </a>is my favorite so far, with JetBeans'' <a href="www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank">WebStorm </a>a not-quite-so-close second.  (If I could get the JsTestDriver plugin working better in WebStorm it would jump to first place, and I would buy it in a heartbeat.  But the plugin is far to quirky, and WebStorm, at least the beta build I''m running to be able to use the plugin, is quite frankly, s-l-o-w.)\n\nI''m using <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/" target="_blank">SharpDevelop </a>as my IDE for .NET code, because my version of VS is 2005 and the Express version of 2010 is missing functionality that I want to use--for instance, profiling and some thread debugging functionality.  I don''t even feel it is worth <em>trying </em>to get CTL to upgrade my copy of VS.  But SharpDevelop is good for an open source project, even with its quirkiness trying to debug code that uses Excel''s interop assemblies.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nIt wasn''t a bad year.  IE 9 beta isn''t a bad browser.  I''ll be looking for a good year and a good browser in 2011!
