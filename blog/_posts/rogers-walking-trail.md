It's springtime (well, almost) and I took a bicycle ride to explore the area.  At first I started looking for an easy way out of my apartment complex while avoiding as much traffic as possible.  There is a small worn path along Hudson Street, but after taking the path  I happened to notice a broken gate leading out of the apartment complex into a parking lot.  This is a much better way out because I can get to the traffic light on Hudson and 24th St without riding by traffic at all.  The only tough part is riding through the middle of a rough, open field--but I have a mountain bike, and on a mountain bike that is part of the fun!

After making it across Hudson at 24th street I thought I might ride to my workplace, but on the way I noticed a paved concrete trail off the right of Olive Street.  This I had to explore!  It turned out to be a nice walking/biking trail through Rogers that leads from Easy Street on the eastern end to Sam's Club in the west.  There is also a nice little city park near the Sam's Club side.

After riding every bit of the trail (that I could see) I rode home full of excitement and told my wife.  This would be a fun trail to ride together, and hopefully help to get her hooked on bicycling too!

Ride Length: 7.78 miles
