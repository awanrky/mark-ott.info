Quick post while I relax before putting up my tent.

Left the house around noon today and thought I would drive through Harrison and see the town where I grew up. Patience was getting restless, so I told her we would stop in Eureka to stretch our legs.

However, as we passed through Gateway I decided to head on up into Missouri instead. It was a good call, because Patience and I found a spot in the middle of the woods in the Mark Twain National Forest where we had lunch, and I let her run free off the leash

She was a good girl, running back to me every time I called. However, she also found a pond to jump in. Lucky for me, she limited it to some wading.

When we left, I kept the GPS zoomed in so I couldn''t tell where we were going, but zoomed out far enough to help me generally head north.

Patience slept for a couple hours. I guess pond wading and running in the woods is tiring!

When she woke up we were near Carthage so I drove in and found a park where we could stretch our legs. It was a nice park, and after we walked around it the first time I grabbed my camera so we could walk around again and get pictures.

We headed back out, and I was going to stop somewhere to eat and search for a place to camp for the night, but I accidentally ended up on 71 north. Oh well, we drove on for awhile, and stopped in the next decent sized town. I grabbed us both a bite to eat, and found Stockton State Park on the map. After a quick call to make sure they had open sites, we headed out.

We are now relaxing in our first camp of the trip, Patience laying on my foot, waiting for me to take her for a walk. We will go soon, after I put up the tent.

Will post pictures later tonight...
