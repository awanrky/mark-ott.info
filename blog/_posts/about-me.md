I am a 42 year old husband, addicted bicyclist, and amateur photographer who works, sleeps, and bicycles in and around Northwest Arkansas.

I have worked with computer hardware and developed software for the past 15 years, most recently as a Systems Analyst at Consumer Testing Laboratories in Bentonville, Arkansas.

About four years ago I picked up a new Trek 4300 mountain bike and started riding it on the dirt roads and trails around the Madison County Wildlife Refuge near Eureka Springs, where I lived at the time.

I quickly became consumed tinkering around with and modifying the bicycle as much as riding it whenever I got the chance.  I was also very easily sold on a new Gary Fisher Cobia 29er within a few months of getting the Trek.

Not long after buying the Fisher I moved near Hobbs State Park and spent the summer riding the Hidden Diversity trails before meeting my future wife in the spring of 2007.  If anything could distract me from riding it was her, and for the most part she did.

We moved to Rogers in 2008, and I took a hiatus from bike riding.  The spring of 2009 has, for the most part due to marriage and lots of time behind a desk, left me 40+ pounds heaver than the year before.  If I didn't have enough incentive to get back out and ride last year, I have great incentive now.  So far this spring I have lost over 10 pounds.  I hope to be back under 200 pounds before the summer ends.

While riding this spring I have had a lot of fun exploring, taking pictures, and mapping my routes.  I kept thinking that I should keep a journal of my rides, and that a blog would be a good format in which to do so.  Also, listening to Jeff Atwood on the<a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/series/stackoverflow.html" target="_blank"> StackOverflow Podcast</a> has provided me with further inspriation to start blogging.

Since this Labor Day weekend has been mostly rainy and I've been stuck inside I decided that now was the best time to get started.

We'll see what develops.  At this point I don't intend to limit this blog to any one area in particular.  I thought I'd post my bicycle rides and maps to start with and let the blog take its own shape.  In other words... 'I have no spec.'
