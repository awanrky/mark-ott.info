Today I took a leisurely ride around town.  I explored a little behind NWACC and saw where the train tracks ran underneath 540.

On the way back I noticed some kids riding on a trail had never noticed before that ran along the train tracks.  I knew there was a trail in this area that headed back towards NWACC but didn't connect because of 540.  What I also knew, because I had just found out about an hour earlier was that the train tracks went under a bridge in this very area.
<p style="text-align: left;">I had to follow the other bike riders, and pretty soon I saw them hop on the train tracks and ride under the bridge.  I followed and ended up at NWACC where I had been just a little earlier.

The ride wasn't bad for my mountain bike, but would be too rough on a road bike.  However, it is short enough that a road bike could be easily walked along the shortcut.

Ride Length: 17.8 miles
Moving Time: 120 minutes
