I was exhausted on Sunday evening, but I still wanted to ride my bike.  I thought I'd just take off north towards Little Flock, but I couldn't find too many roads up that way that didn't turn dirt.

I ended up in Avoca, and started trying to ride for speed.  I didn't do too bad, but realized that I have a long way to go before I get as fast as I'd like to be.

Ride Length: 23 miles
Moving Time: 91 minutes
Bike Ridden: LeMond
