I thought I''d just take off north towards Little Flock, but I couldn''t find too many roads up that way that didn''t turn dirt.\r\n\r\nI ended up in Avoca, and started trying to ride for speed.  I didn''t do too bad, but realized that I have a long way to go before I get as fast as I''d like to be.\r\n\r\nRide Length: 23 miles\r\nMoving Time: 91 minutes\r\nBike Ridden: LeMond\r\n\r\n<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/06-21-2009tporb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-208" title="06-21-2009tporb" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/06-21-2009tporb.jpg" alt="06-21-2009tporb" width="1000" height="755" /></a>
