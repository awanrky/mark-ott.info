I''ve been shopping for a new compact camera ever since <a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/?p=141" target="_self">sending my old Sony compact flying</a> last year.\r\n\r\nI didn''t have many requirements for the replacement.  I''m not very concerned how many megapixels the thing has, and I don''t even care about a large LCD screen, touch screen, or most other features.  I just want it to be fairly inexpensive (well under $100), and have at least a 3x zoom.   And I don''t want a red camera.\r\n\r\nI figured I''d shop around after Christmas and see if I could find a deal, but was mostly unsuccessful.  Then I took a trip to Best Buy to look for some PC3200 memory.  However, at nearly $70 for a 1GB stick, I decided I would find a place to order it online instead.\r\n\r\nOn my way out I stopped to look at the cameras.  They didn''t have anything under $100, but I did see something on some of the cameras that I hadn''t seen before.  That is a 5x zoom on a compact camera.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I ended up paying $130 for this Samsung SL-620.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/samsung-sl6201.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231" title="Samsung SL620" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/samsung-sl6201-2.jpg" alt="Samsung SL620" width="394" height="270" /></a>It was much more than I wanted to spend, and the only thing that really sold me was the 5x optical zoom.   There were two other drawbacks to the camera that I even decided to put up with.  One is that this camera doesn''t use AA batteries-it uses a special rechargeable instead.  The other thing I don''t like is that it doesn''t use the USB mini-B connector that I''m used to, and that I have many spare cables for.  Oh, and it''s red.</p>\r\n\r\nI''m pleased with my purchase so far.  I got a wraparound case for it and carry it in my coat so I have it wherever I go.  We''ll see what kind of pics I get.\r\n\r\nI can''t wait for spring!
