Hudson had a little activity, but it was still completely covered in snow.\n\nWhen I got back to the apartment, I grabbed the keys to Freedom''s car and started it up.  After I had reviewed the pictures I had taken, I went back out to her car and was able to peel the ice off the top--it was now ready for a trip to the store.  We headed out about an hour later, and one lane of Hudson was already showing pavement.  By the time we left the store all four lanes were showing pavement.  We stopped by my car and I broomed the snow off the top (breaking my broom handle in the process,) leaving a layer of ice that I hope will melt much faster now.\n\nFreedom is planning a trip to Fayetteville tomorrow, and gladly I''m fairly confident that the roads will not be too dangerous.  Maybe I''ll even get my car out and do something that gets me out of the house again.
