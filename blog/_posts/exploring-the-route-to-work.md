Today I decided to do a trial run of the route to get to work, using the bike path I found on my last ride.  It took about 30 minutes to arrive in the parking lot, and I was fairly tired when I got there.

After leaving the west side of the bike trail I found my way through the residential neighborhood so that I didn't have to enter traffic on Olive Street until I was almost out of Rogers.   The ride on the bridge over 71 with traffic going past wasn't fun but it wasn't as bad as I feared.

After heading back towards home I explored the walking trail some more, and found that it crosses Olive Street and I followed this path until its end at Walnut Street.

Ride Length: 16.58 miles
