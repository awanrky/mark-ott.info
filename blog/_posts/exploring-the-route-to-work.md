Today I decided to do a trial run of the route to get to work, using the bike path I found on my last ride.  It took about 30 minutes to arrive in the parking lot, and I was fairly tired when I got there.\n\nAfter leaving the west side of the bike trail I found my way through the residential neighborhood so that I didn''t have to enter traffic on Olive Street until I was almost out of Rogers.   The ride on the bridge over 71 with traffic going past wasn''t fun but it wasn''t as bad as I feared.\n\nAfter heading back towards home I explored the walking trail some more, and found that it crosses Olive Street and I followed this path until its end at Walnut Street.\n\nRide Length: 16.58 miles\n\n<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/03-22-2009tpomb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20" title="Explore the Route to Work" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/03-22-2009tpomb.jpg" alt="Explore the Route to Work" width="1189" height="748" /></a>
