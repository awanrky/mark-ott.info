I left the campground around noon on Saturday, riding out into the hot day.  It was a bit much in all the hills and heat and humidity, but it was still a fun ride.  I ended up at the bridge on Highway 12, then headed up to Beaver Shores.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_199" align="alignleft" width="500" caption="Golf Course at Dream Valley"]<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/golf_course_at_dream_valley_photo0261.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-199" title="golf_course_at_dream_valley_photo0261" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/golf_course_at_dream_valley_photo0261.jpg" alt="Golf Course at Dream Valley" width="500" height="210" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nI rested at the top of a hill by a sign at the entrance to Beaver Shores, listening to a couple in a nearby house yell at each other.  I couldn''t quite make out what they were arguing about, and I wasn''t really interested, but there was nice shade.\r\n\r\nThe ride wasn''t very long because it was too hot for an extended ride.  I found myself resting in the shade every time I saw some.  Before I got back I decided that I wouldn''t be able to take many long mid-day rides for awhile.  I''ll have to ride early morning or late evening.\r\n\r\nRide Length: 13.8 miles\r\nMoving Time: 90 minutes\r\nBike Ridden: LeMond<a href="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/06-20-2009tporb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-197" title="06-20-2009tporb" src="http://mark-ott.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/06-20-2009tporb.jpg" alt="06-20-2009tporb" width="954" height="897" /></a>
