I left the campground around noon on Saturday, riding out into the hot day.  It was a bit much in all the hills and heat and humidity, but it was still a fun ride.  I ended up at the bridge on Highway 12, then headed up to Beaver Shores.

I rested at the top of a hill by a sign at the entrance to Beaver Shores, listening to a couple in a nearby house yell at each other.  I couldn't quite make out what they were arguing about, and I wasn't really interested, but there was nice shade.

The ride wasn't very long because it was too hot for an extended ride.  I found myself resting in the shade every time I saw some.  Before I got back I decided that I wouldn't be able to take many long mid-day rides for awhile.  I'll have to ride early morning or late evening.
